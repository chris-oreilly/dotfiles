There are no interesting tricks here that you might like to copy, just my very *personal* preferences. Therefore, I **do not** recommend cloning, forking, or doing anything else with this repository. Its location on github, as opposed to a private repo, is mainly for convience and, to a lesser extent, to make my account a bit homier.
